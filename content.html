    <h1>Ecological Intelligence Across Substrates</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Ecological Intelligence Across Substrates project. This is the public development environment for me, Veylan Solmira. My paradigm is publish-centric and community dominated.</p>
    
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project's goal is to encourage myself, organize the results, and share with the community a combination of technical machine learning and AI understanding, along with vegan-centered ecological appraisal of the near-future of digital beings existing alongside biological organisms, such as humans. My current evaluation is the odds of coordination in human societies to avoid some of the worst AI outcomes are low, while the capitalist context in which AI development is occuring induces systemic biases in regards to safety and justice of probable AI outcomes. I think veganism and the broader ecological paradigm, especially when supplemented with state of the art technical insight have the greatest chance of avoiding dystopian outcomes.</p>
